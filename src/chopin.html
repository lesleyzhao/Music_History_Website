                Frédéric François Chopin was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era, known for his solo piano pieces. He grew up in Warsaw, later part of Congress Poland. As a prodigy, Chopin finished his education and early compositions in Warsaw, leaving for Paris at 20 just before the November 1830 Uprising. Settling in Paris at 21, he gave only 30 public shows in his last 18 years, favoring intimate salons. He earned by selling compositions and teaching piano. Chopin befriended Franz Liszt and was respected by peers like Robert Schumann.</p>

                    Chopin's compositions all feature the <mark>piano</mark>. Predominantly for solo piano, he also wrote two piano concertos, chamber pieces, and 19 Polish songs. His works are <mark>technically challenging</mark>, pushing the piano's boundaries; his performances were renowned for their <mark>subtlety</mark>. Key piano pieces include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, ballades, études, impromptus, scherzi, preludes, and sonatas, with some released posthumously. His style drew from Polish folk music, classical influences like Bach, Mozart, and Schubert, and the Parisian salons he frequented. Chopin's stylistic and harmonic innovations, and his <mark>melding of music with nationalism</mark>, left a lasting mark on the Romantic era and beyond.</p>

                    Frédéric Chopin is emblematic of the <mark>Romantic era</mark> in music, an epoch characterized by <mark>deep emotional expression, individualism, and a keen sense of nationalism</mark>. His works, predominantly for the piano, encapsulate the quintessence of Romanticism with their lyrical melodies, intricate harmonies, and profound sensitivity, ranging from the intimate whispers of his nocturnes to the fervent passion of his polonaises. Notably, he drew inspiration from <mark>Polish folk music</mark>, integrating its rhythms and melodies into his compositions, which thereby served as a musical emblem of his homeland. The broader Romantic movement, with composers like Liszt, Schumann, and Brahms, similarly prioritized personal emotion and often <mark>looked to their native cultures for inspiration</mark>. This focus on national identity, combined with a heightened emphasis on self-expression and emotional depth, distinguishes Romantic music from the classical traditions that preceded it.
